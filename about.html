          <!-- Introduction. -->
          Hello, I'm Aashiq Abrahams! I'm a passionate web developer who loves
          to create amazing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe
          in the power of coding to make a positive impact on the digital world.
          Coding allows me to transform ideas into interactive and dynamic
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- Learning from others when coding. -->
          When it comes to coding, I believe in the importance of continuous
          learning and collaboration. I actively seek opportunities to learn
          from others in the coding community, whether it's through online
          forums, coding meetups, or open-source projects. Learning from fellow
          developers not only enhances my skills but also exposes me to
          different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- Networking in the tech industry. -->
          Networking is a crucial aspect of the tech industry, and I value
          building professional connections. Networking has allowed me to
          exchange ideas, gain insights into emerging technologies, and even
          discover new career opportunities. I'm enthusiastic about connecting
          with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology and
          innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- Additional interests. -->
          Apart from coding, I have a variety of interests. I enjoy spending my
          free time fishing at serene rivers, hiking in the great outdoors, and
          staying active at the gym. These hobbies allow me to relax and
          recharge, and they also provide inspiration for my coding projects. In
          addition, I cherish spending quality family time, whether it's
          exploring new places, playing board games, or simply enjoying each
          other's company.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- Gaming interests. -->
          I'm also a gaming enthusiast. I love diving into virtual worlds and
          competing in games like GTA 5, Dota 2, PUBG, and Forza. Gaming not
          only offers excitement and challenge, but it also connects me with a
          global community of fellow gamers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- Benefits of gaming. -->
          In the gaming world, I enjoy exploring intricate narratives in
          single-player adventures and engaging in intense multiplayer battles.
          I find that gaming sharpens my strategic thinking, teamwork, and
          reflexes, skills that also contribute to my coding journey.
